# Adaptive Importance Sampling for Rare Event Simulation in Fault Tree Analysis

Estimating failure probability in complex systems where failures are extremely rare (P ~ 10⁻⁶ to 10⁻³). Standard Monte Carlo requires millions of simulations with most yielding no failures. This project uses Graph Neural Networks to predict optimal biasing parameters (α, β) for Importance Sampling, significantly reducing variance while maintaining accurate probability estimates.
